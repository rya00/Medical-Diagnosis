# This file has a slightly different structure with more focus on certain variables such as Hand and MR_Delay.
# The Visit variable is also conditioned based on Group and Hand, assuming that the visit number could be influenced by those factors.
# Relationships like P(eTIV|Group, MMSE) highlight the dependency of brain volume (eTIV) on group classification and cognitive score (MMSE).

# Stuck in a loop
