# name: The name of this configuration is nb-mri-neuro-structure-0.01, which reflects the neuro analysis on MRI data.
# random_variables: The key features from your dataset are included (e.g., Group, M_F, Visit, Hand, MR_Delay, Age, EDUC, etc.).
# structure: This defines the conditional relationships:
# P(Group) is a root variable with no conditions.
# P(M_F|Group) indicates that gender (M_F) depends on the group (Group).
# Similarly, other variables like Age, EDUC, and SES are conditioned on other relevant features (like Group and Age).
# Complex dependencies like P(CDR|MMSE, Age, Group) represent relationships where CDR (clinical dementia rating) depends on MMSE and Age.

# Stuck in a loop
