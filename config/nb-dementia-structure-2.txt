# This config adds more specific interactions between variables like Hand and Age, with a focus on cognitive scores (MMSE, CDR) and neuroimaging features (eTIV, nWBV).
# It models the relationship between Hand (presumably left or right hand) and other clinical measures, as well as neuroimaging metrics like nWBV (normalized brain volume).
